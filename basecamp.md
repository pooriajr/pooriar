Hey Basecamp, 

I'm Pooria Rashidi, a web developer from Tucson, Arizona. I'm *thrilled* to get this rare shot at joining the Basecamp team. So cutting to the chase, I want to explain why I think I'd fit right in at Basecamp.

## Manager of One

For years I've been a one-man-tech-team for a handful of small businesses owners.

It's been my job to understand problems, weigh potential solutions, propose the best fit, implement it, and then provide ongoing support. My clients don't have the desire or domain knowledge to manage me, so they put a lot of trust in me to do right by them without oversight. This means I'm in charge of planning, design, development, marketing, and the ultimate success of the project.

At Basecamp you look for self-sufficient workers, and I think I'm good for that. Plus you have this incredible team to work with. The best of both worlds.

## Problem solver

Reading the list of recent work done on Hey, it's clear that you don't need pixel pushers - you need problem solvers. I've got plenty of experience with that, since my freelance work constantly requires me to tackle new and unfamiliar problems. 

This has put me in touch with with different tools and technologies. But more importantly, it's given me practice in the art of deliberate learning. Now when I face an unfamiliar problem, I can efficiently figure out what's needed to solve it, without someone holding my hand.

## Multidisciplinary

HTML, CSS, JS, HTTP, Ruby, Rails. These are table stakes for a Basecamp developer, and I have years of experience using them to solve problems for businesses. But beyond that, I also have professional experience in graphic design, UI/UX design, illustration, copywriting, and digital marketing. And while programming is my strength, I think the combination of all these disciplines is a superpower on small and fluid teams like at Basecamp.

## Team player

I know it's a cliche, but I historically work well with others. I've been working solo lately, but when working at companies in the past I took great care to develop relationships with everyone, and I still maintain some of those friendships to this day. There were disagreements of course, but we handled them without hard feelings. Basecamp is a small team with long tenures, and I would take great care to maintain a friendly work environment for the long term.

## Why Basecamp?

I've been freelancing for years, so why do I want to work at Basecamp now?

Simply put, Basecamp is special. Your principles around technology and business are rare. And the conviction to actually operate by those principles even rarer. I see Basecamp as living proof that tech companies can be *better*, for their employees, for their customers, and for large chunks of society. And with Hey and Hotwire it's clear that you're not slowing down. I am deeply appreciative of what Basecamp does, and I would be honored to be a part of it.

Thank you for your hard work! Fingers crossed that I hear back soon.

- My article on repurposing Reddit's ranking algorithm got [published as the top story](https://hackernoon.com/from-reddits-hot-ranking-algorithm-to-my-satisfying-blend-or-top-ranked-and-new-by2h35tm) at Hackernoon. 
- I [documented my process](https://pooriar.com/behind-the-scenes-vim-animation) going from totally clueless to making a 3D animation of the vim logo.
