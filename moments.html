<h1>Moments</h1>
<small>Just so you know, I write these moments purely for myself. They're vague and flowery because I don't need them to be understood by everyone. But if you like them, that's cool too :)</small>

{% for moment in site.moments %}
<div class="moment">
  {{ moment.content }}
</div>
{% endfor %}
