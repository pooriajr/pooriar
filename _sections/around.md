I've got a [twitter]({{site.twitter}}) which I should really post to more often

I'm open to getting random emails from internet strangers: pjrashidi@gmail.com (how much spam am I going to get for posting this here?)

My [github]({{site.github}}) has a couple public repos, nothing crazy (except my .vimrc)

I'm not on any other social media, intentionally
