My mother, my ultimate supporter. Words fail to describe how much you have done for me.

My father, your patience and love are sturdy like mountains.

Aaron, who opened my mind (and made me laugh more than anyone).

Brian, who kept teaching despite me being the worst student.

And one more... you know who you are.
