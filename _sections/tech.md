I make websites and web applications with HTML, CSS, JS, and Ruby.

Ruby on Rails is my favorite competitive advantage. Thanks DHH!🚂

I use vim for text editing, so of course I had to tell you. 💁‍♀️

How can I use technology without letting it consume my life? Tech wants to be everything and everywhere. It offers enormous rewards for adopting it. But I'm also wary; the best parts of life can't be found in the cold silicon.
