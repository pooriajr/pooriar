🇮🇷 + 🇪🇺 Visited my family in Iran several times, with stops in Europe in between. Thanks, Dad!

🇳🇿 Studied abroad 1 semester in New Zealand. Thanks for that too, Dad! 😊

🎒 Backpacked across Europe and Asia for 6 months after losing my job. Thanks, unemployment! 😜

🇹🇼 Lived in Taiwan for 3 months. My favorite country for food!

🇰🇷 Lived in South Korea for a year. It feels like a second home.

🇨🇷 Fled to a jungle camp in Costa Rica in the middle of the pandemic. No COVID, just monkey sh🙊t!

🇨🇴 I'm in Colombia now!📍
