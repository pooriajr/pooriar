Let me just get this out of the way: if you're one of those people whose heart rate doubles at the mere mention of "vegan", hear me out. I'm not really "a Vegan" anymore than someone who spent a week on a boat is "a Sailor". 

I've only been on an exclusively vegan diet for a few months here, a few months there. Not even a year of my life in total. And steak is my favorite food! How's that for an olive branch.

Ok, if you're done huffing, please put down the steak knife and let me tell you some interesting benefits I noticed when I tried out veganism.

## Compulsive behavior melted away

I have always struggled with certain compulsive behaviors. Nail-biting is a big one. Endless internet browsing, another. These behaviors were stubborn, resisting every attempt to rid myself of them.

After just a few weeks of eating a vegan diet, they disappeared on their own. It took no effort on my part, the compulsion itself had simply dissolved.

Later, when I returned to a non-vegan diet, these compulsions came back quite shortly afterward.

## Less stress over the cost of food

Sometimes I do this thing at restaurants, where I start thinking about how much money I'm spending on the meal. Given the quality and quantity of the food, how much value am I getting here? I calculate how much more I'm spending by not cooking my own food, and then extrapolate that difference over time to forecast the long term cost. If the numbers don't look good, I'll feel worried and guilty.

What was I eating again?

Eating vegan gives me an unexpected way out of this kind of thinking.

It's because a lot of vegan restaurants are like underdogs: 
- They're small and scrappy, with a smaller customer base than other types of restaurants
- They resemble a labor of love as much as a business. The owners are passionate about healthy living and environmental impact.
- The food is way better than most people give it credit for

All this mean that eating at these restaurants feels less like a cold transaction that needs to be optimized, and more like an act of generosity from both parties.

This easily comforts the anxious mind. It's okay that I pay a bit more. I'm supporting good people by paying a bit more, and they're supporting my health by continuing to run their underdog business.
