First off, a disclaimer: I'm not really "a Vegan" anymore than someone who spent a week on a boat is "a Sailor". That said, even in my short experiments with veganism, I noticed profound changes, so I want to share my observations.

## Compulsive behavior melted away

I have always struggled with certain compulsive behaviors. Nail-biting is a big one. Endless internet browsing, another. These behaviors were stubborn, resisting every attempt to rid myself of them.

After just a few weeks of eating a vegan diet, they disappeared on their own. It took no effort on my part, the compulsion itself had simply dissolved.

Later, when I returned to a non-vegan diet, these compulsions came back quite shortly afterward.

## Less stress over the cost of food

Sometimes I do this thing at restaurants, where I start thinking about how much money I'm spending on the meal. Given the quality and quantity of the food, how much value am I getting here? I calculate how much more I'm spending by not cooking my own food, and then extrapolate that difference over time to forecast the long term cost. If the numbers don't look good, I'll feel worried and guilty.

What was I eating again?

Eating vegan gives me an unexpected way out of this kind of thinking.

It's because a lot of vegan restaurants are like underdogs: 
- They're small and scrappy, with a smaller customer base than other types of restaurants
- They resemble a labor of love as much as a business. The owners are passionate about healthy living and environmental impact.
- The food is way better than most people give it credit for

All this mean that eating at these restaurants feels less like a cold transaction that needs to be optimized, and more like an act of generosity from both parties.

This relaxes my anxious mind. "It's okay that I pay a bit more. I'm supporting good people by paying a bit more, and they're supporting my health by continuing to run their underdog business."

## My mind adjusted very quickly

You'd expect that a lifetime of delighting in animal products would make it hard to cope with their absence. It's not just about taste - eating good steak or good sushi is an *emotional* experience for me. 

Indeed it was hard at first. Seeing someone eating a fresh pepperoni pizza made me feel like I was missing out. I felt the craving, and had to reject it.

But after a few weeks, those cravings were so weak I could barely notice them.

I was still aware that I would enjoy the taste of that food, but there was no pain in it, no feeling of missing out.

Instead I started craving and appreciating good vegan food, which I would get from restaurants.

And once I decided to stop eating Vegan, my mind quickly reverted to its pizza loving ways.

## Conclusion

I had ideas of what to expect going into veganism, and a lot of that turned out to be true. But the most important outcomes were total surprises, like the disappearance of compulsive behaviors.

For me this shows that there is no replacement for actually doing something yourself. You can read about it and think on other people's experiences, but you shouldn't be confident in your conclusions until you see for yourself.
