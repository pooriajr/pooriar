Ever since I was 4, my parents (divorced) had joint custody while living on opposite sides of the US. This meant that I flew back and forth between them a dozen times every year. 

In official terms, I was an "unaccompanied minor", because I was traveling alone.

(My child brain wondered why I was being called a *miner* ‚õèüßí)

Between the ages of 4 and 14, I flew over 100 such flights, but I didn't realize it was a somewhat unusual thing for a child to fly without their parents until I was an adult and realized something.

When I fly now, I **never** see kids doing what I was doing when I was little.

I don't think it's merely lack of attention. I think it's probably just pretty rare for kids to fly solo. And if I hadn't done it myself, I probably wouldn't even realize that airports have a whole system for this.

So now, for all you who never asked, here's what it was like to fly as an unaccompanied minor.

## Departure

At some point, my mother or father would hand me off to the care of a flight attendant. 

Pre 9-11, that would happen in front of the gate, or sometimes *inside* the plane, if my father was feeling extra sentimental. Post 9-11 my parent wouldn't be allowed through security, so a flight attendant would escort me and sit me somewhere they could keep an eye on me while I waited to board.

I remember the flight attendants were always extremely friendly and attentive. As an adult I still feel that way, but of course they're extra nice to kids.

When I boarded, it was always in the very back or very front of economy. Sometimes I was sitting with another unaccompanied minor, which was always fun because I'd have a guaranteed friend for the flight. But usually I was just next to an adult stranger. 

This was all in the late '90s' to late '2000s, and I wonder if they still sit kids next to strangers in 2021.

## Best Layover Ever

After we landed, the flight attendant would have me wait until the entire plane emptied out, and then escorted me out of the plane and to the secret kid's room.

I say secret because the entrances for these rooms were always very discreet. The door was totally plain and unremarkable, or tucked away around a corner. 

But behind those boring entrances was the most fun room of my childhood. A room full of toys, video games, and a bunch of other kids to play with. The walls were covered in colorful characters, the furniture was all kid-sized. 

It was like an all-you-can-eat buffet of fun, and I had hours to play with whatever I wanted. It seemed like there were no adults to ruin the fun, although surely there was a supervisor who was so uninvolved that I don't remember their presence. 

Eventually the fun had to end though, as a new flight attendant came around calling my name to take me to my next flight.

Sometimes I had 2 layovers. 2 kid's rooms. Awesome.

I saw so many different kid's rooms that I'm pretty sure every airport has one; adults just don't realize it.

## Riding the cart

Sometimes we'd hitch a ride on one of the golf-cart type things that airport workers and handicapped people use. That was a big perk. I felt like I was getting the VIP treatment while everyone else had to walk.

## Goodie bags

Sometimes I'd even get a goodie bag. The best ones had model planes in them, usually plastic but sometimes metal. They made nice souvenirs, but I was more interested in doing takeoffs and landings off the arm rest and tray tables (while making airplane noises of course).

## Arrival

Once my final flight arrived, I once again had to wait until the plane was empty, and then the flight attendant escorted me out.

Pre 9-11, my mother or father would be waiting right at the gate, but, well you already know how that is now.

These are decade old memories and who knows how things have changed since then. But I like to think that in every airport there are still secret kids rooms full of kids having fun, just out of sight of all the bored adults.
