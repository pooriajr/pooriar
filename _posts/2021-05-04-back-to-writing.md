Hey there! It's been a while since I wrote. But now I'm going to pick it up again in earnest.

I'm going to write about random things. Whatever tickles my fancy.

Quantity over quality, let's get over this hesitance.

I'm not going to put as much pressure on myself to make it all deep or important. Or to even follow a trend. 

But I will share one thing I'm learning every day.

Today I learned about Jekyll, the static site generator. It's older and slower than other options, but it has some built in features and opinions that make it nice for use as my blog.

For example:
{% highlight ruby linenos %}
easy = code_formatting.is_built_in?
if easy
  p "This example is super contrived and cheesy,but yeah it's built in."
end
{% endhighlight %}

Easy SEO and sitemap plugins

And it's not Javascript! ðŸ˜‰

It's got clean yaml files instead of ugly JSON.

Yeah, I'm sticking with Jekyll.
