Defaults are good. The more you stray from defaults, the more you invite 
unexpected problems. 

I am trying to stick to defaults more seriously. Unless I have a real good 
reason to switch, then I will try to stick with the default. For example, using 
default settings is always a good idea, because it gives you massively improved 
mobility.

Your experience carries over. Contrast this to rejection of defaults.

Reprogram yourself to use a dvorak keyboard. Congrats, now no one can use your 
computer, and you can't use anyone else's.

Maybe the payoff is worth the price. You have to judge that on a case by case 
basis. For me, after many forays into customization, I find myself now leaning 
heavily to the "stick to defaults" side. 

Customizations are a liability. Aligning yourself with defaults means that your 
special case is not so special, it's already been fixed, and if it hasn't there 
is a #1 hit in google with the answer to your problem just waiting for you.

This is one reason I really like Rails. It's so old, and the defaults are so 
clear, that finding solutions to problems is a breeze. I don't run into obscure 
things, just obvious things that thousands of other devs have experienced and 
posted about online.
