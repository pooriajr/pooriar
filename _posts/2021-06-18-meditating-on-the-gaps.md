I started paying attention to the "gaps" in my day. Waiting for my food to arrive. Waiting for a file to download. Taking a bathroom break.

These are gaps - spaces between what I was doing and what I want to do. I've gotten into the habit of filling these gaps. I do it quickly, without thinking. The excuse is that I'm using time efficiently. I'm usually not.

In a life spent mostly rushing from one task to the next, those gaps are precious. A chance to slow down and truly *rest*, even if just for a moment.

Now I do a sort of meditation. It's not a formal thing. It's not a productivity hack - "Trying to meditate but can't find the time?? Squeeze in a 3 minute session while you're on the pot?!" No, not like that. 

I just take a moment to notice I'm in a gap. I acknowledge what is happening around the gap. 

"I'm waiting for food. I have nothing urgent to attend to in this moment. I'm holding my phone, the impulse is to check, but I couldn't actually tell you what I'm looking for. I can put it down. My breathing is a bit shallow. Let me slow it down a bit. Relax my shoulders. It's a nice day, I'm comfortable. Appreciate the moment."

Consciously slowing down and deepening my breaths is the best part. I've identified that my breathing is uncomfortably shallow, which goes hand in hand with tension and anxiety. I'm trying to consciously practice deeper breathing so my default slowly shifts that way.
