title: Anki Lexicon
---

I'm experimenting with a different way of using Anki.

In the past I used it as a memorization tool for language learning. Anki is 
very good for that. This is a little different.

My anki lexicon is a mental sculpting tool.

## The Mental Windwaker
Memorization is of course a big part of that. But another aspect is training 
the way my mind thinks.

For example, if I want to train my mind to employ second-order thinking more 
often, I can add a snippet about the topic into my anki deck. It's not a 
definition that I need to memorize - I already know what it means.

It's more of a cue to run my mind through certain processes, light up certain 
neurons, and strengthen their pathways. It's very simple, but the potential is 
exciting.

In this way, I can easily shape my brain with **intention**. The world already 
shapes our minds with the chaotic winds of events totally out of our control.  
But using Anki in this way lets me take just a little control of those winds.

## The Knowledge Repo

It also serves as an overall knowledge repository.Think of how innefficiently 
we learn sometimes. I know when I learn something in code, such as a solution 
to a bug, that learning is usually something I will need again in the future.  
But unless that problem occurs regularly I tend to foget a large percnt of 
those solutions right after I use them the first time.

In coding, that can result in hours of struggling over something that I've 
already solved in the past. 

Instead, if I add that knowledge as a quick and sloppy Anki card the **first** 
time I learn it, then just a few seconds of review every now and then will lock 
it in, saving me time in the future and accelerating my mastery of the topic.
