<p>You know how people have trophy rooms so when they're feeling worthless they can look around and remind themselves that maybe they're not such a failure after all?</p>

<p>This is my trophy room. Replete with cheesy gold gradients.</p>

<p>Also, who are you and what are you doing here!? This room is secret!</p>

<div class="flow">
  {% assign trophies = site.collections | where: "label", "trophies" | first %}
  {% for trophy in trophies.files reversed %}
    <div class="trophy">
      <img src="/trophies/{{trophy.name}}" alt="">
    </div>
  {% endfor %}
</div>
